        <h1>Privacy Policy for CLASSIC CNF App</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 26, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>CLASSIC CNF</strong>, a webview browser app designed exclusively for CLASSIC CNF customers to access their transaction history, invoice history, and other related data securely through our servers. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The CLASSIC CNF app <strong>does not collect, store, or process any personal data</strong> from users. The app is a webview browser that allows customers to access their transaction history, invoice history, and other basic data directly from our servers.</p>
        <p>Since the app does not require any permissions from your device, we do not access or collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (e.g., model, operating system).</li>
            <li>Location data.</li>
            <li>Contact information.</li>
            <li>Any other personal or sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>As the app does not collect any user data, there is <strong>no usage of personal information</strong>. All data accessed through the app is stored securely on our servers and is only accessible to authorized users with manual access provided by CLASSIC CNF.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take data security seriously. All data accessed through the CLASSIC CNF app is protected by secure server protocols, including encryption and access controls. However, since the app itself does not collect or store any data, there is <strong>no risk of data breach through the app</strong>.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The CLASSIC CNF app <strong>does not integrate with any third-party services</strong> that collect, store, or process user data. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and provide clear information about the third-party services and their data practices.</p>

        <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
        <p>While the CLASSIC CNF app does not collect or store personal data, users have rights under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
